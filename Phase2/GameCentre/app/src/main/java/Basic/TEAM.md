### Meeting notes:

[
Meeting No.1 (Oct.22)
We did the CRC of phase 1, and we draw 5 different cards to show the connections between each 
classes. We also set up our phase 1 repository successfully.
Meeting No.2 (Oct.24)
We finish the README.md and TEAM.md files in tut.

Meeting No.2 (Oct.29)
We finish the design part of the project. We finish the CRC and uml of this project together.
And we separated the project into 5 main part: User-UserManager, Game-GameManager, Activities, 
Scoreboards and a MainClass. Runqi Bi writes User-UserManager, Shang Liu and Qi Zou writes 
Activities, Quan Xu does Scoreboards and Zijin Zhang does Game-GameManager. We will wirte 
the MainClass together, since the MainClass is the top class that organize all classes.
In the following days, we are going to finish each part of the project and we are going wo have a 
another meeting on this Saturday.
//
Meeting No.2 (Nov.1)
Today we had some small meetings. Qi Zou and Shang Liu exchange the ideas about how to do 
activities with Runqi Bi, Quan Xu, Zijin Zhang. Then Runqi Bi and Quan Xu discuss the implementation 
of User and UserManager, and come up some new ideas. Quan Xu and Zijin Zhang have argument about the 
logic of Autosave() method, BUT we had agreed on several points regarding how to use AutoSave and 
the structure of AutoSAve() and so on. So our group is dong well right now.
//
Meeting No.3 (Nov.4)
We almost finish every's parts of the projects. All of us had a meeting for the whole day
combining them together, found and solved some existing and potential bugs and errors.
Also, we complete and finalize the login function, save and load function, set complexity
function as well as the score board. Out final design decide to use the Main
class to achieve all operation to the data and objects and we ensure that the Main class is singleton.
By the end of this meeting, we finished most of the feature of the game.
//
Meeting No.4 (Nov.5)
We had another whole-day meeting and we finally complete the development of all functionality
of this game. We tested the undo function, checked if there is any logic error regarding to
the game score and the score board. Furthermore, we redesigned some parts of the user interface
of the game to make it looks clear and nice. Finally, we deleted all the unnecessary code,
fixed the warning and code smells. Additionally, we also developed an game lunch center as well as
the unlimited undo function. For our next task, we well keep working changing the background image
of each tiles and make it possible for user to use their own picture as the background.
\\
Meeting No.4 (Nov.5)
Today is the last day! Right now, we group together and test the game over and over again. And we 
changed the context of the info that shown to the player. We check the correctness of our java doc 
finally. The only thing that is sad is we cannot finish the goal task(changing the background image 
of each tiles and make it possible for user to use their own picture as the background), but we will 
try it again later. For our next task(phase 2), we will working on it as soon as possible.

Meeting No.6 and No.7 (Nov.15/18)
We met in TUT section, and we discussed about the two new game. Each of us had 2 ideas of the the

"Flip to Win". And we separated our group in two minor groups. Qi Zou, Liu Shang, Runqi Bi were
group 1 and Quan Xu, Zijin Zhang were group 2. Group 1 was working the game, 'Color Matching', and
