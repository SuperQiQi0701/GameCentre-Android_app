### Description of the game:

* [This is an puzzle game where you must arrange the numbers in the correct order to win the game, 
every winner of the game gets a score. The player who process less movements to win the game, 
and would get a higher rank on the scoreboard. 
First, when the players open the app, they can choose to log in with the correct password(if 
they already have an account),change password(if they already have an account and want to change 
their password),or register(if they don't have an account). An available account name should be 
an email address which contains a "@" symbol. An register-able account should be an email address 
that have never been registered before. The player can change password only if they enter the 
right account name and the right old password.
Once the player log in to the game, they can choose a game from the Game Centre(but currently only 
have one game: Sliding Tiles). After they have chose a game, they can choose between 3 options: 
new game(which is to start a new game); load saved game(which is to load a game the player saved 
before with the corresponding level they chose previously) and resume(which is to resume a game 
that is auto-saved if the phone restarts or is turned off ). 
If they choose a new game, they are able to choose the level of the game they want to play. 
We have three levels for the players that have different complexities. Level 1 Sliding Tile is 3x3 
and with 9 tiles; level 2 Sliding Tile is 4x4 and with 16 tiles; level 3 Sliding Tile is 5x5 and 
with 25 tiles. 
During the game, there are two buttons on the top, one is undo and the other is save. The players 
can press undo button to undo their last move. But they can only undo if they processed a movement 
before, and if they are not able to undo, there would be a message telling that undo failed. 
Besides, they can keep on undoing until there are no movement to undo. However, since this game is
counting steps, every time the player undo, they would get a penalty which is add 1 extra step(
so if you press undo, you can see the current step increased by 2, 1 for a movement, 1 for penalty, 
1+1=2, so in total 2 steps would be added). The save button is for, when players want to quit the
app, but want to save current progress. So the player can simply press the save button on the top, 
and next time they can just press Load Saved Game to get back to their saved board. 
On the top right conner of the game view page, it would show the player's current steps, which 
starts from 0 initially. Once a player win the game, it would jump to a Score Board page, which 
shows their current steps, their highest rank, and also the world's top 5 rank of the current
game.
Besides, if you want to log out your current account during the game or during any time, you can 
just keep on pressing the back button until it gets to the first page.]
